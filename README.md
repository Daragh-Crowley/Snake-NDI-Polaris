https://www.ndigital.com/medical/products/polaris-vega/

The snake is controlled by moving the tracking instrument left, right, up and down within the tracking space.
The Vega Optical tracker is normally used for tracking surgical instruments with an absolute position mapping. This game shows that the raw data from the tracker can be used for relative displacement tracking. 
The game interface is made by plotting the position of the snake body and the apple and updating the plot for each movement.
